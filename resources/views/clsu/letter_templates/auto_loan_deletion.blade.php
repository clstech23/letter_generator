To Whom It May Concern: 
</p>
  <br><br>

 <p>
 I recently received a copy of my credit report and I noticed some account/s on my consumer report that should not be on there. I demand the below accounts be deleted from my consumer report immediately.
 </p>
  <br><br>

  <p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;List of accounts to be deleted
 </p>
  <br><br>

  <p>
  The reporting of these account(s) is/are violations of 15 USC §1681a, The Fair Credit Reporting Act
[15 USC §1681(a)(2)(B)]:
  </p><br><br>

  <p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)Exclusions.—Except as provided in paragraph (3), the term “consumer report” does not include—
 </p>
  <br><br>

  <p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) any authorization or approval of a specific extension of credit directly or indirectly by the issuer of a credit card or similar device;
 </p>
  <br><br>

  <p>
  So let me explain. Under the Truth in Lending Act 15 USC §1602(g), “credit card” is defined as the following:
</p><br><br>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term “credit card” means any card, plate, coupon book or other credit device existing for the purpose of obtaining money, property, labor, or services on credit.
 </p>
  <br><br>

  <p>
  This makes my social security card, driver’s license/ID, and license plate credit cards that are/were used for the extension of credit.
</p><br><br>

<p>
I am writing in regard to the above-referenced account/s and transactions. This vehicle was purchased at (dealership name) Date (the date it was purchased).  
</p><br><br>

    <p>
